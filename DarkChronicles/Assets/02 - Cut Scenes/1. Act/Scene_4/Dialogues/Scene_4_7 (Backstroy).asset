  sentences:
  - I didn't try to keep this a secret from you. I just thought you should be old
    enough.
  - Now i think there is no way around it anymore.
  - 15 years ago, when i put my boxes near the river...
  - ... there was a basket floating along it.
  - Obviously, i was curious.
  - As I looked into it, I found a child.
  - The child was wrapped in a blanket. It seemed to be hand knit.
  - In the corner, there was a word stitched into it.
  - It was "Namu".
