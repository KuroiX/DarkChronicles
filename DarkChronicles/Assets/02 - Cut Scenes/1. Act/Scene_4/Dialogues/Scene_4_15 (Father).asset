  sentences:
  - There is another reason why I am telling you this.
  - There is a legend, that one who has the power can lift the barrier.
  - '"one who has the power"...'
  - It was obvious to me that it had to be you.
  - The legend says there is a temple to the west of the village. Only those who
    have the power can enter it.
  - If you want to know more about the barrier and your fate, you should look for
    that temple.
  - But keep in mind, that the journey is going to be dangerous.
  - I always tried not to tell you, because I was afraid I could lose you.
  - If you decide to uncover the truth, be careful.
